# Code Repository for Temporal Converters (Java)

This repository provides code used for exercises and demonstrations
included in the Java version of the
[Securing Application Data](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/appdatasec)
training course.

It's important to remember that the example code used in this course was designed
to support learning a specific aspect of Temporal, not to serve as a ready-to-use
template for implementing a production system.
